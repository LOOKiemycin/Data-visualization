# Microfractionation
Microfractionation involves bioactivity-guided ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with a diode array detector (DAD) to analyze secondary metabolite crude extracts from actinomycetes. This approach identifies compounds of interest based on their relative bioactivity. This repository provides Python, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, for plotting HPLC chromatograms aligned with inhibition assay results.
