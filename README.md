# Microfractionation
Microfractionation is a bioactivity-based ultra performance liquid chromatography/DAD of secondary metabolite crude extract of actinomycete. The result will give relatively of interesting compounds against bioactivity.
This repository demonstrates python 3 code using jupyter notebook for plotting HPLC chromatogram align with inhibition assay.
