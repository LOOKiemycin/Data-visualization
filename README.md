# Microfractionation
Microfractionation based bioactivity-guided with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to diode array detector (DAD) to analyze secondary metabolite crude extracts from actinomycetes. This approach identifies compounds of interest based on their relative bioactivity. This repository provides Python, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, for plotting HPLC chromatograms aligned with inhibition assay results.
